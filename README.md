## What is InTruck?

As part of Swinburne University's capstone project, our team, in collaboration with Swinburne researchers and iMove CRC, created an IoT device and service that monitors truck cargo bay conditions.

Built from a Raspberry Pi base, the device itself uses sensors to monitor interior conditions such as temperature, humidity, drops and sudden movement as well as integrating a GPS to track location and speed. It connects via LTE and sends this data to the cloud, with a battery backup in place in cases where the truck is switched off.

The information from multiple devices is collated on a web interface, which shows the location, interior conditions and any alerts present. It also provides a historial view, so that previous journeys can be analysed.

Below is a short video overview of the project:
